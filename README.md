Integrated reservoir simulation, production analytics, and EOR studies using tNavigator

## Overview
This project presents an integrated oil and gas field study covering reservoir simulation, production performance analysis, enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and techno-economic screening. This work is based on a fictional offshore carbonate field developed for portfolio purposes.

## Tools Used
- tNavigator (academic license)
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI

## Project Structure
- Reservoir modelling and simulation
- Production data analytics and diagnostics
- Polymer flooding EOR evaluation
- Techno-economic analysis

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Reservoir simulation workflow
- Production performance analysis
- Data-driven EOR optimization
- Engineering decision-makiing using data

## Disclaimer
This is a fictional field and all data are synthetic, created solely for educational and portfolio purposes.
