# Project 1: Integrated Reservoir Modeling and Production Forecasting Using tNavigator

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a simplified but realistic reservoir simulation
model to generate production data for further analytics, performance diagnostics, and EOR
evaluation. The study demonstrates an end-to-end reservoir engineering workflow using
tNavigator (academic license).

## Field Description
- Field name: Neptune Selatan Oilfield (fictional)
- Location: Offshore Malaysia
- Reservoir type: Carbonate
- Drive mechanisms: Solution gas drive, waterflood support
- Development concept: Producers with peripheral water injection

## Model Description
- Grid type: Cartesian
- Number of layers: 3
- Porosity range: 0.18–0.25
- Permeability range: 50–300 mD
- Fluid model: Black oil
- Fluid properties generated using standard empirical correlations

## Simulation Scenarios
Three development scenarios were evaluated:
1. Natural depletion
2. Waterflood
3. Polymer flooding (screening-level model)

## Key Results
- Waterflooding significantly improved pressure maintenance and delayed production decline
- Polymer flooding provided incremental recovery compared to conventional waterflooding
- Early water breakthrough was observed in selected producers, indicating heterogeneity effects

## Deliverables
- Reservoir simulation model (tNavigator)
- Production rate and pressure datasets (Excel/CSV)
- Visualization of production trends and water cut behavior

## Disclaimer
This project is based on a fictional field. All data are synthetic and created solely for
educational and portfolio demonstration purposes.
